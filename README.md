# Hosting a Resume Online

In this assignment, I am going to show you how you can succesfully host a resume, written in markdown language, on Github Pages, a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. We will follow the key principals and tools mentioned in Andrew Etter’s book _Modern Technical Writing_ : a lightweight markup language (_Markdown_), a static site generator (_Jekyll_), distributed version control sysytem (_Git_) and hosting on a website (_GitHub Pages_)

## Prerequisites

Following the tools mentioned by Etter, you will need

- Markdown
- A Markdown editor (e.g., VScode)
- A static site generator(e.g., Jekyll)
- GitHub Pages
- A resume formatted in Markdown.

## Instructions

If you look at the above picture, you can see a resume formatted in markdown which is one of the tools mentioned in Andrew Etter’s book _Modern Technical Writing_.

To learn more about Markdown, check out "More Resources" at the bottom of this file.

- lightweight markup languages (like AsciiDoc and Markdown),
- static site generators (such as Sphinx),
- distributed version control systems (like Git or Bitbucket), - constantly iterating/updating doc content on your website based on analytics,

For this assignment, I am using VSCode editor to create the resume formatted in markdown. You can download VScode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

To host the resume online, you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup?source=login) account where we will keep the codes.

## FAQs

Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

> Markdown is simple, effective tool for writing and formatting documents meant to reside on the web. It has limited functionalty which makes it easy to learn and it only requires a text editor to craete and format the document. It can be converted to many other formats unlike word processor documents which may lose some

Why is my resume not showing up?

> Make sure the keep you resume file name "index.md" as this is the main file that is displayed on the github page. Additionally, keep the file in the root directory.
