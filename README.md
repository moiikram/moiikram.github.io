# Hosting a Resume Online

In this tutorial I am going to show you how you can succesfully host a resume, written in markdown language, on Github, a popular code repository.

One Paragraph of the project description

## Prerequisites

To get started on on your way you will need

- Markdown
- A Markdown editor
- A static site generator like Jekyll
- GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages
- A resume formatted in Markdown.

## Instructions

If you look at the above picture, you can see a resume formatted in markdown which is one of the tools mentioned in Andrew Etterâ€™s book _Modern Technical Writing_.

- lightweight markup languages (like AsciiDoc and Markdown),
- static site generators (such as Sphinx),
- distributed version control systems (like Git or Bitbucket), - constantly iterating/updating doc content on your website based on analytics,

For this assignment, I am using VSCode editor to create the resume formatted in markdown.

To host the resume online, you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup?source=login) account where we will keep the codes.
